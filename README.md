# Simple Password Generator Written In Python!

```This Python program, created by Luiz Gabriel Magalh√£es Trindade, serves as a straightforward yet effective password generator. Distributed under the GPL3 License, you can find the details of the license [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html#license-text).

The program utilizes the `customtkinter` library for the graphical user interface and the `pyperclip` library for copying the generated password to the clipboard. The password is generated based on a set of characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

The user can adjust the password length using a slider that ranges from a default minimum of 16 to a maximum of 64 characters. As a visual aid, the current password size is displayed on the interface. When the user clicks the "Generate!" button, a password is generated, displayed on the interface, and copied to the clipboard for easy use.

This simple yet efficient password generator provides a user-friendly experience with a clean and visually appealing interface. Feel free to explore and customize it according to your preferences!```
